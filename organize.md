I discuss both the ways I could group stuff and the places I can put
things in bags. Once I decide which stuff goes together, I can make a
roll of fabric with special pockets and then put the roll in the
appropriate pocket of the appropriate bag.

## Stuff

### Needs easy access

Laptop computer

* Acer Aspire One 725-0488
* power adapter

Phone

* Phone (Nexus S)
* Many micro-USB cables

### Doesn't need easy access

Electronics

* American and European power cables
* Another phone

## Places
My [Tom Bihn Synapse 19](http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0110.html)
has these pockets

* Main pocket
  * Flap within the main pocket
* Water bottle pocket
* Under the water bottle pocket
* Left and right pockets
* Bottom pocket

My four Vaude panniers will each have one big inner pocket and two outer
pockets (top and bottom).
